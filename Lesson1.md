## What is Creative Coding?

### Applications of Creative Coding
- Art
  - Generative Art
  - Interactive Art
- Data visualization
- Games
- Music
- Education

### Examples:
- [A train ride](https://editor.p5js.org/reajmorais/full/8UxKOWank)
- [Bubble words](https://editor.p5js.org/design.teo.ryu/full/I1PRivFtl)
- [Quilter](https://editor.p5js.org/ilovit/full/M7vOG2aoQ)


## Introduction to P5 Js

### Setup 
- Create an account on P5 Js online editor (allows you to save your sketches)
- [P5 Js online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)

### Editor breakdown
- Code editor : where you write your code
- Console : where you can see any errors in your code or debug using print statements
- Canvas : where your sketch is displayed
- Saving your sketch (with a name)

### What is P5 js?
p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

Using the metaphor of a sketch, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.


### What can I do with P5js?

- [P5js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)


## Anatomy of a P5 Js sketch
A P5 Js sketch has two main functions:
- [draw()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/draw) - This function is called continuously. It is used to draw shapes, images, text, etc. on the canvas.
- [setup()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/setup) - This function is called only once. It is used to set the canvas size, background color, etc.
- [createCanvas()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCanvas) - This function is used to create a canvas on which you can draw shapes, images, text, etc.
- [background()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/background) - This function is used to set the background color of the canvas.
- Color Theory
  - How does color work on the web? [RGB](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp) and [Hexadecimal](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp)
  - [Color Picker](https://coolors.co/ffffff)
- Color Palettes:
  - [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/)
  - [Coolors Palettes](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending)
  - [Coolors Palette Generator](https://coolors.co/generate)
- Logging to the console
  - [print()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/print)
  - [console.log()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log)
- Debugging errors

### Code Sample:

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    background(220);
    // background(220, 0, 0);
    // background(0, 220, 0);
    // background(0, 0, 220);
}
```


## Drawing in P5 Js
- Coordinates in P5 Js
  - [0,0] is the top left corner of the canvas
  - [width, height] is the bottom right corner of the canvas
  - [Image of coordinates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_wXIeQAHf2j1jcX0tlaFG2xD1m8pRRzP/view?usp=share_link)
- Adding Shapes
  - [rect()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect)
  - [ellipse()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse)
  - [triangle()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle)
  - [quad()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/quad)
  - [arc()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/arc)
  - [line()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/line)
  - [point()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/point)
- Adding colors to shapes
  - [fill()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/fill)
  - [stroke()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/stroke)
- Composing Shapes
  - Smiley Face
  - [Blueprints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E2E_v5FrM-jVk7eTA5GOkro44niKzHpj/view?usp=share_link)


### Code Sample:
```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
    background(220);

    // rect(x, y, w, [h])
    // x - x coordinate of the top left corner of the rectangle
    // y - y coordinate of the top left corner of the rectangle
    // w - width of the rectangle
    // h (optional) - height of the rectangle (default is same as width if not specified)
    rect(10, 10, 50, 50);
    rect(10, 70, 160, 90);

    // ellipse(x, y, w, [h])
    // x - x coordinate of the center of the ellipse
    // y - y coordinate of the center of the ellipse
    // w - width of the ellipse
    // h (optional) - height of the ellipse (default is same as width if not specified)
    ellipse(40, 200, 50, 50);
}
```

## Variables
- Custom variables
- Built in variables
  - [width](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/width)
  - [height](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/height)
  - [mouseX](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseX)
  - [mouseY](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseY)
- Using mouseX and mouseY to draw shapes
- Creating a rudimentary drawing app

```javascript

let fillColor;
function setup() {
    createCanvas(400, 400);
    fillColor = '#D25380';
}
function draw() {
    background('#FFFAF4');

    // Set the stroke to black to color the line
    stroke(0);
    line(200,0,200,400);

    // Remove the stroke so that the shape does not have an outline
    noStroke();

    // Set the fill color 
    fill(fillColor);
    // Draw the ellipse at the current mouse position
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
}

function mousePressed(){
    // When the mouse is pressed, change the fill color
    // based on the mouse position
    if(mouseX < 200){
        fillColor= '#D25380';
    }else {
        fillColor = '#E08E6D';
    }
}
```
